# How to build a development environment

`rhc-worker-playbook` is part of the `yggd` environment, so it will need the same as [`yggd`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/yggdrasil/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to be tested and developed.

# Pre-requisites
*yggdrasil/rhc*: Connects the MQTT broker with the appropriate worker, `rhc-worker-playbook` in this case.

It can be compiled using the including `Makefile` or executed just with the `go run` command. `rhc`is part of RHEL systems, it can be used instead of using `yggdrasil`.
This requires `pub` and `sub` modules. To get these modules:

```console
$ go get git.sr.ht/~spc/mqttcli
$ go install git.sr.ht/~spc/mqttcli/cmd/...
```

*MQTT broker*: Needed to publish messages. [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) is easy to set up and an excellent broker that can be run offline and locally. The online [solution](https://test.mosquitto.org/) can be used but is not recommended.


*HTTP server*: An optional HTTP server used to request payloads from localhost. This does not need to be more complicated than using the Python's `SimpleHTTPServer` module.

# Install rhc-worker-playbook develop setup

`rhc-worker-playbook` needs some devel packages prior to install the `develop-setup` script, which may take some time to run as it downloads and install everything needed to the `rhc-worker-playbook`.

```console
$ sudo dnf install c-ares-devel openssl-devel python3-devel gcc gcc-c++
$ ./develop-setup.sh
$ sudo make dev-lib-dir
```

Additionally it can be used through `rhc` installing the `rhc-worker-playbook` as a worker.

```console
$ sudo make CONFIG_DIR=$(pkg-config rhc --variable workerconfdir) installed-lib-dir
$ sudo make build
$ sudo make install CONFIG_DIR=$(pkg-config rhc --variable workerconfdir)
```

# Test environment Quickstart

This environment recreates the `rhc-worker-playbook`, in which an `ansible playbook` is sent through the MQTT broker, `yggdrasil` processes it and send it to the worker to execute it.


**TERMINAL 1**

Run an *HTTP server* that will serve the payload. Then run `mosquitto` service.

```console
$ nohup python3 -m http.server 8000 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
$ mosquitto
```

**TERMINAL 2**

Run `yggdrasil` specifying `mosquitto` as the MQTT server.

```console
$ sudo go run ./cmd/yggd --server tcp://localhost:1883 --log-level trace --socket-addr @yggd
...
subscribed to topic: yggdrasil/localhost-22278168-85a6-11ec-a65c-fa163e3b5a61/data/in
...
```
Or, if it is using via `rhc`.

Configure in rhc the `moquitto` connection and the log level.

```console
cat /etc/rhc/config.toml
# rhc global configuration settings

broker = ["tcp://localhost:1883"]
cert-file = "/etc/pki/consumer/cert.pem"
key-file = "/etc/pki/consumer/key.pem"
log-level = "bug"
```

**TERMINAL 3**

Associate the `@yggd` socket with the `rhc-worker-playbook` worker.

```console
sudo YGG_SOCKET_ADDR=unix:@yggd python3 /usr/libexec/rhc/rhc-worker-playbook.worker
```
This step is not needed if using the worker through `rhc`.

**TERMINAL 4**

Execute the publish message in the "control/in" topic. Using `yggctl` to generate the data message with the Ansible playbook `test-module.yml` served by the HTTP server and `rhc-worker-playbook` as the directive.

```console
 go run ./cmd/yggctl generate data-message --directive "rhc-worker-playbook" \"http://localhost:8000/test-module.yml\" | pub -broker tcp://localhost:1883 -topic yggdrasil/$CLIENT_ID/data/in
 ```


`$CLIENT_ID` can be found in the prompt of the TERMINAL 2, when `yggdrasil` is launched. The output tells the topic it is subscribed, in there the `$CLIENT_ID` can be found. Or in the logs of the `rhc`.

 ```console
subscribed to topic: yggdrasil/localhost-22278168-85a6-11ec-a65c-fa163e3b5a61/data/in
CLIENT_ID = localhost-22278168-85a6-11ec-a65c-fa163e3b5a61
 ```

Alternatively, `yggdrasil` has a variable in its config file to determine the `client_id`. If the worker is running through `rhc` this `$CLIENT_ID` can be found in the logs of `journalctl`.

```console
# journalctl -u rhcd -f

```

# How to contribute

 ## Running tests

Any proposed code change in `rhc-worker-playbook` is automatically rejected by
`GitLab CI Pipelines` if the change causes test failures.

It is recommended for developers to run the test suite before submitting patch
for review. This allows to catch errors as early as possible.

### Preferred way to run the tests

The preferred way to run the linter tests is using `tox`. It executes tests in
an isolated environment, by creating separate `virtualenv` and installing
dependencies from the `test-requirements.txt` file, so the only package you
install is `tox` itself:

``` shell
$ python3 -m pip install tox
```

For more information, see [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/). For example:

To run the default set of tests:

``` shell
$ tox
```

To run the style tests:

``` shell
$ tox -e linters
```
## Code Guidelines
- Commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) pattern.
- Commit messages should include a concise subject line that completes the following phrase: "when applied, this commit will...". The body of the commit should further expand on this statement with additional relevant details.
